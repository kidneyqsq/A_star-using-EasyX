Implement A* algorithm using EasyX 
Hi, everyone. As a new entrant into autonomous dring, I try to implement A* algotithm using cpp and EasyX and make it successful.

A_star.h -- stores A* algorithm 
SearchArea.h -- is mainly about map drawing using EasyX

Highly appreciated if you could help find and solve issues in my code.
